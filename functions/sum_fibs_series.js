// Build an Odd Fibonacci Sum Calculator
// In this lab you will build an odd Fibonacci sum calculator that computes the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to a given positive integer.

// Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

// User Stories:

// You should have a sumFibs function that accepts a number as an argument.
// The sumFibs function should return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to the given number.
// The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous ones.
// Only the odd Fibonacci numbers should be added to the sum.






function sumFibs(num) {
  let prev = 0;
  let curr = 1;
  let sum = 0;

  while (curr <= num) {
    if(curr%2!=0){
    sum += curr;
    }
    let next = prev + curr;
    prev = curr;
    curr = next;
  }

  return sum;
}

console.log(sumFibs(10));
